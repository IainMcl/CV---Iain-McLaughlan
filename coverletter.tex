\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a recent graduate of the University of Edinburgh where I achieved a 2:1 B.Sc (Hons). I am a performance orientated individual who works hard to archive high-level performance in whatever I do. This is shown through my sporting career in sailing where I have been part of several performance programs achieving national and world champion titles along the way. Along with this, I have also worked as a sailing coach working with the RYA Scotland performance team to develop young athletes to achieve their potentials while working as part of a national team.

\lettersection{Why Cloudreach?}
Helping companies move to a more cloud-based approach is great as it allows for companies to expand and develop their business in modern ways. The need and excitement around cloud-based solutions are evident by your huge success in a relatively short space of time along with the diversity of clients you work with. From reading and watching videos from your current employees one of the main stand-out features you value is how important the people are that work with you and I would love to be a aprt of such a comunity.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
While at University I have taken a particular interest in software development and data analysis. This interest led to me choosing more programming based subjects such as Modelling and Visualisation in Physics' and 'Quantum computing projects' where I have worked individually and as part of larger teams to develop larger programs. Along with this I also chose the topic of my Senior Honours Project to be 'Estimating Galaxy Redshifts using Random Forests'. In this project, I compared several methods of estimating galaxy redshifts focusing on the differences between classical techniques and machine learning methods such as Random Forests with a brief look into Self Organising Maps (SOMs). Most of my university courses were taught in Python so a large proportion of my experience is in this language. However, alongside my academic subjects, I have also been learning C and C++ in my own time to gain a deeper understanding of what is involved in a more performance based, memory management language.
