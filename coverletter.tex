\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Healthcare Scientist (Epidemiologist) working with Public Health Scotland. I have come into this role from a background as a physicist and data analyst. I am a keen sailor who has raced at many large championships. I have always taken a keen interest in the technical side of racing and have attempted to make my own sailing computer software system in the past to work around the challenges that are faced by recreational racers who don't have infinite budgets. My roles, this, and other projects have given me large amounts of experience working with software, data, and hardware. In my current role I rely heavily on my data and development skills to provide real time data on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland investigating vaccine effectiveness and failure. This involves handling large data sets and merging information from a range of sources, cleaning, wrangling, and presenting data and insights. I am a high achieving success driven individual who looks to maximise performance and efficiency and have applied this drive to all areas of my life.


\lettersection{Why Sailmon?}
I have seen your products being used in a wide range of racing and training setting. I have used your technology and firmly believe that it is some of the best racing solutions available. I particularly like you how cater for both yachting and dinghy racing as I feel there is a large gap in performance dinghy racing where meaningful data can be collected and processed to allow sailors to move away from having a feeling that they are sailing well, allowing them to \textbf{know} they are sailing well. When looking at your business model I am impressed with the range of products that you provide covering many different aspects of performance sailing. This makes you stand out over other companies who focus mainly around information display.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I believe that my skills and experiences in sailing, data, and software put me in a great position to be able to work well within your team. I can provide novel ideas that I have not seen in consumer sailing solutions along with developing reliability and ease of use with current solutions. My data visualisation skills could provide opportunity to provide alternatives to single digit displays to something potentially more visual allowing for the racer to spend more time focused on the bigger picture. An opportunity like this would mean a lot to me as it would allow for me to combine two of my passions: data and software, and sailing.
