I have recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh studying physics where I achieved a 2:1 BSc(hons). Alongside this I also work as a sailing race coach for Royal Yachting Association - Scotland where I along with others, deliver the RYA Scotland performance sailing programme. Throughout my studies I have developed a keen interest in software development and design. As a result of this interest I have developed my programming and data analysis skills both in and out of organised courses where I have worked mainly in Python, however, also have developed skills in other languages such as LaTeX, C/C++ and Cython. I aim to improve these skills and continue to develop them further by finding work in the industry working on larger scale problems than I have faced so far.
