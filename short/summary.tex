I am a motivated individual who seeks performance in all aspects of my life. Whether that be in work, looking to refine, optimise, and improve; in coaching where I to work to produce the highest performing sailors in the country; or in sport (sailing) where I consistently look for the next edge that will make us faster and better.\newline
I am a Healthcare scientist (epidemiologist) working for Public Health Scotland, where on top of my scientific role I play a large part in the real time data and analytics providing information and guidance relating to the COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness program.\newline
With this and other projects, I use and have experience of a range of tech including Python, R, and C. My skill using these tools allows for fast development of perfomant solutions to many problems.\newline
I am seeking a position that will provide challenging opportunities to use and develop my skills to solve new problems. This role will allow me to use leading edge technology and methodology to improve, adapt, and overcome.
