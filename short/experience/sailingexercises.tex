    To help organise coaching ideas helping myself and other sailing coaches 
    I developed a website using the Django python web framework. This site 
    acts as a collaborative database to store and find different sailing 
    exercises that can be searched for inspiration based on criteria such as 
    time availability, number of participants, etc. The site has its back end 
    developed in python with the front end built using vanilla Javascript, 
    HTML5 and CSS3. The site is deployed using Digital Ocean running a 
    PostgreSQL database. The site has various flourish add ons such as using 
    crontab to post updates and most recent posts to Twitter daily.\newline
