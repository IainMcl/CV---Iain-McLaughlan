            Over the last few months I have been taking an active roll in a 
            community project looking to make it harder for bike thieves to 
            sell stolen bikes. This project is still on going, but, aims to 
            use image and text recognition to match images of stolen bikes 
            with those posted on popular online market places. I am currently 
            taking a leading roll in the web application side of the project 
            before flipping over to the image and text recognition side. We 
            are using Deno and MongoDB on the back end and Svelte to develop 
            the front end. We are working in a loose Agile framework using 
            communication tools including Slack and Trello to track progress 
            and share ideas.\newline
