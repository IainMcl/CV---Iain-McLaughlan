      As an associate instructor I provide a teaching role for Sport Scotland 
      Cumbrae, where I work as part of a team with other instructors to 
      deliver a range of RYA sailing courses from complete beginner to 
      advanced racing. In this role, I often give people their first 
      experiences trying a new activity where they need to learn a new and 
      unfamiliar set of skills.\newline
