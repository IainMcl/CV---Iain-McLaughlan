        I organise and deliver coaching sessions to the top youth (u21) 
        sailors in Scotland. This involves communication with governing bodies
        , host venues and participants to organise each session. Each year I 
        work with the sailors in the team to plan out a training program to 
        allow them to perform at their best in the coming season and future 
        careers. I have to work with them to set goals, plan for contingencies
        , and evaluate success at all points throughout their journeys.\newline
        Within this role, I have coached four UK national championship 
        medallists with one of my sailors this year being invited to be part 
        of the UK's senior Olympic pathway program.\newline
