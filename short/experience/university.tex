    While studying at the University of Edinburgh I have taken a range of 
    courses resulting in the following skills: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Computing and Data Analysis.
        \item Problem Solving.
        \item Independent Learning
        \item Critical Thinking.
    \end{itemize}
    During my degree, I have been exposed to a wide range of experiences that 
    have expanded my knowledge and skill base, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mathematical skills, from courses such as: Dynamics and Vector 
            Calculus, Fourier Analysis and Statistics, Algebra and Calculus 
            in preparation for courses in Quantum Physics and Electromagnetism.
        \item Being part of a project team to develop a quantum computer 
            simulation in Python.
        \item Using \textit{ScikitLearn} to set up a machine learning weather 
            prediction system.
        \item and one of my final year projects compared different methods 
    that could be used to estimate the redshifts of galaxies that involved in-
    depth research to gain an understanding of the different methods; machine 
    learning for some methods to gain a working understanding of the methods 
    employed; data analysis to support quantitative and qualitative 
    interrogation of the results and report writing.\newline \end{itemize}
