    As a healthcare scientist I have worked on Scotland's COVID-19 response by 
        providing real time data and analysics, guidance, and public facing 
        information on vaccine effectiveness and failures.\newline
        I have worked to develop surveillance systems that collect data from a range 
        of data streams and combined them in novel ways to produce meaning from the 
        data. I then clean, prepare, and analyse the data to be presented using a 
        range of formats. These include written reports (one example can be found 
                here: \href{https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/covid-19-statistical-report/}
                {\textit{PHS COVID-19 weekly statistical report}}), presentations to 
    partners, consultants and chief executives, and interactive web based 
        dashboards.
