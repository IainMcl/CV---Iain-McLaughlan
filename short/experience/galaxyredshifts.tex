     {%Developer
     %As a final year project I compared different methods for estimating the redshifts of distant galaxies. This compared different machine learning methods such as \textit{Random Forests} and \textit{Self Organising Maps} along with more classic template fitting methods. The data was collected making use of \textit{SQL Databases} and analysed with python code making use of \textit{Numpy} and \textit{Pandas}. With the outputs being visualised with a mix of \textit{Matplotlib} and \textit{Gnuplot}.
