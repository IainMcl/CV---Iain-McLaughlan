         Construction of a quantum computer simulator from scratch, which 
         simulates the quantum phenomena found in quantum computers on a 
         classical system using linear algebra to represent the effects. The 
         performance of this was analyses through simulating many tests and 
         statistical comparisons were made to expected results. For 
         collaborative work \textit{GitHub} was used for version control, 
         allowing for better work planning and time management.\newline
