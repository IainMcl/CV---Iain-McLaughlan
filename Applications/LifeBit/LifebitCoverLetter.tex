\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Healthcare Scientist (Epidemiologist) working with Public Health Scotland. I have come into this role from a background as a physicist and data analyst. I am a keen sailor who has raced at many large championships. I have always taken a keen interest in the technical side of racing and have attempted to make my own sailing computer software system in the past to work around the challenges that are faced by recreational racers who don't have infinite budgets. My roles, this, and other projects have given me large amounts of experience working with software, data, and hardware. In my current role, I rely heavily on my data and development skills to provide real-time data on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland investigating vaccine effectiveness and failure. This involves handling large data sets and merging information from a range of sources, cleaning, wrangling, and presenting data and insights. I am a high achieving success-driven individual who looks to maximise performance and efficiency and have applied this drive to all areas of my life.


\lettersection{Why Healios?}
Being able to provide additional methods for people to access quality health care and support is very important for individual outcomes. Services like Healios allow for individuals to access the support, care, and long term plans that they need in a timely manner can only improve individual outcomes. Through the use of technology, you are allowing for more people to reach out to receive and follow through with care plans. As more healthcare services become more centralised, combining many services into one physical location runs the risk of people needing to prioritise travel and other commitments to fit around necessary health care services. Through the use of technology and in-person services that Healios is doing, choices like these should become less common giving people more opportunities to access health services. 


\lettersection{Why Me?}
I pride myself on being able to do work that can meaningfully help people. I can use my data skills and knowledge to find and utilise insights found in data. I work well collaboratively with others to rationalise problems and find efficient solutions. I believe that this opportunity within Healios will provide me with new challenges to work on and I could bring new approaches to tackle them.
