        To help organise coaching ideas helping myself and other sailing coaches I developed a website using the Django python web framework. This site acts as a collaborative database to store and find different sailing exercises that can be searched for inspiration based on criteria such as time availability, number of participants, etc. The site has its back end developed in python with the front end built using vanilla Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. The site is deployed using Digital Ocean running a PostgreSQL database. The site has various flourish add ons such as using crontab to post updates and most recent posts to Twitter daily.

      While studying at the University of Edinburgh I have taken a range of courses resulting in the following skills: 
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Computing and Data Analysis.
          \item Problem Solving.
          \item Independent Learning
          \item Critical Thinking.
      \end{itemize}
      During my degree, I have been exposed to a wide range of experiences that have expanded my knowledge and skill base, including:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Mathematical skills, from courses such as: Dynamics and Vector Calculus, Fourier Analysis and Statistics, Algebra and Calculus in preparation for courses in Quantum Physics and Electromagnetism.
          \item Being part of a project team to develop a quantum computer simulation in Python.
          \item Using \textit{ScikitLearn} to set up a machine learning weather prediction system.
          \item and one of my final year projects compared different methods that could be used to estimate the redshifts of galaxies that involved in-depth research to gain an understanding of the different methods; machine learning for some methods to gain a working understanding of the methods employed; data analysis to support quantitative and qualitative interrogation of the results and report writing.
      \end{itemize}

    %   During my degree I have had a wide range of experiences. I have developed my mathematical skills by choosing maths for physics courses including Dynamics and Vector Calculus, Fourier Analysis and Statistics, Algebra and Calculus. This prepared me for courses such as Quantum Physics and Electromagnetism.} 
      
    %   In addition I have been involved with projects which cover more niche areas. I worked as part of a team to develop a quantum computer simulator using Python. I completed projects where $\it{Scikit\space Learn}$  was used to set up a machine learning weather prediction system. In my final year I undertook a project that made a comparison of different methods that could be used to estimate the redshifts of galaxies. This combined many skills in to one project. In depth research was required to gain an understanding of the different methods. Machine learning for some of the methods so a working understanding of the methods that were employed here were needed. Lastly, data analysis skills were used to quantitatively and qualitatively compare and understand the results of the project.
