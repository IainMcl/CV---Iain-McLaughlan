% For Developer role or Data analyst
2019 Physics graduate from the University of Edinburgh with a 2:1 BSc(hons). Alongside this, I am employed as a head race coach for Royal Yachting Association Scotland (RYAS) where I along with others deliver the RYAS performance sailing programme. During my studies, I have developed a passion for software development and design. As a result of this, I have focused on expanding my programming and data analysis skills, both in and out of organised courses. I have mainly worked in Python, however, I have also developed skills in other languages such as LaTeX, C/C++ and Cython. I plan to enhance these skills through the acquisition of employment in this industry.
